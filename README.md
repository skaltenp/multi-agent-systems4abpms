# Online-Appendix for "Large Language Model-based Multi-agent Systems for Adaptive and Autonomous Process-Aware Execution" (Under Review)

# Installation
```
conda create -f environment.yml
```

# Run
Currently it is only supported to run the _results.ipynb_ because we currently negotiate with the data providing company to make the data open-source.

Based on _results.ipynb_ you can see our results and with the other files you can get an idea of how the evaluation was completed.
